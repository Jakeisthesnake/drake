This branch contains two files which, together, list all experimental CI jobs
that correspond to a production job, in the form of requests to execute those
jobs on a pull request. The lists are separated into those jobs which run from
a clean environment ("unprovisioned") and those which use an already-set-up
build environment ("provisioned").
